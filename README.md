# Dimensionality Reduction: Compress MNIST with Scikit-Learn

Chapter 7 of Hands-On Machine Learning as a practitioner applies it: fit PCA on MNIST, choose the number of components from the explained-variance curve, compress and reconstruct images and measure what was lost, speed things up with randomized and incremental PCA, compare with a random projection, unroll a Swiss roll with LLE and map digits in 2-D with t-SNE, show that a classifier on the compressed features keeps its accuracy, then save a PCA-plus-classifier pipeline and serve it on raw images.

## How to run

```bash
python scaffold.py
```
